## Selection Guidelines

### Recommended Design Values for Storm Drains

1. **Concrete Pipe (new)**: n = 0.013
2. **Corrugated Metal Pipe**: n = 0.024
3. **PVC/HDPE (smooth)**: n = 0.011
4. **Vitrified Clay**: n = 0.014
5. **Concrete Gutter**: n = 0.016

### Factors Affecting Roughness

1. **Age and Deterioration**: Older pipes may have higher n values
2. **Joint Quality**: Poor joints increase roughness
3. **Alignment**: Bends and misalignment increase effective roughness
4. **Deposits and Debris**: Sediment accumulation increases n
5. **Inlet/Manhole Losses**: Local losses at structures

## Notes

- For design, use "Normal" values unless specific site conditions warrant minimum or maximum values
- Higher n values provide more conservative (lower) capacity estimates
- Consider using slightly higher n values for pipes expected to accumulate sediment
- For pipes with multiple materials in series, use weighted average or most conservative value
